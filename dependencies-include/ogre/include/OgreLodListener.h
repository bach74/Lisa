    /** A interface class defining a listener which can be used to receive
        notifications of lod events.
        @remarks
            A 'listener' is an interface designed to be called back when
            particular events are called. This class defines the
            interface relating to lod events. In order to receive
            notifications of lod events, you should create a subclass of
            LodListener and override the methods for which you would like
            to customise the resulting processing. You should then call
            SceneManager::addLodListener passing an instance of this class.
            There is no limit to the number of lod listeners you can register,
            allowing you to register multiple listeners for different purposes.

            For some uses, it may be advantageous to also subclass
            RenderQueueListener as this interface makes available information
            regarding render queue invocations.

            It is important not to modify the scene graph during rendering, so,
            for each event, there are two methods, a prequeue method and a
            postqueue method.  The prequeue method is invoked during rendering,
            and as such should not perform any changes, but if the event is
            relevant, it may return true indicating the postqueue method should
            also be called.  The postqueue method is invoked at an appropriate
            time after rendering and scene changes may be safely made there.
